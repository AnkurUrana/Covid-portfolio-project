# Covid-portfolio-project
This code is a collection of SQL queries that analyze and extract data from tables named "CovidDeaths$" and "covidvaccination" in a database called "Portfolioproject."
The queries utilize various SQL commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and JOIN to retrieve specific information from the tables. 
Some of the queries focus on specific locations, while others provide global or continent-wide statistics.
The queries also use mathematical calculations such as division and summation to calculate percentages and rates related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population.
The last few queries also create a temp table named "percentpopulationvaccinated" to store the result of a specific query.
The purpose of the project is to analyze and understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic by providing insights on death rates, infection rates, vaccine distribution and population. 
With this analysis, one can understand how the pandemic spread and progressed in different countries and continents, and how the vaccine rollout has been done.
